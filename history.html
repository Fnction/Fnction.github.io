    <h1>History of Police Brutailty</h1>
    
    <p> 
      Police start in England but they were not really police officer they were more like nightwacther but they really didn't do anything they 
      mainly drank and sleep they also raid base to get weapons and other thing they need. The police really didn't get a bad name until there 
      were news and how people really start to open there eyes to police and how the police were trying to have pwoer on the citzen 
      espically on the African American. People start to open there eyes when the news start to get out and how they want people to fear them.
